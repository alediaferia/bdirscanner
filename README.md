# BDirScanner
This repository contains some utility function for scanning and taking snapshots of directories.
It all started out of curiosity and since it's sometime I'm not giving love to this project
I thought sharing it with the community may help.

Requirements
------------
* At least [Boost](http://www.boost.org) 1.55 is required for this project to work.
* There's also some timid C++11 usage so `std=c++11` is required as well.
* Oh, and [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) is the build system in use here.

Setup
-----
Not much.

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
```

Contributing
------------
Please, refer to [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) for instructions on how the project is set up.
Consider forking and pushing your merge requests, I'll be happy to accept them :)
